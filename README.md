RASA Game Development
Overview
RASA Game Development is an exciting project focused on creating a 2D top-down shooting game inspired by classic titles like Zelda. The project aims to provide an engaging gaming experience with dynamic dash mechanics, precise controls, and a variety of weapons. This is a group project and by no means do I own the entire code I am using this project to showcase my abilites as we update the changes.

Features
Dynamic Dash Mechanics: Enjoy an action-packed gaming experience with dynamic dash mechanics that allow for up to three consecutive dashes within a 0.35-second cooldown period.

Precise Controls: The integration of GDScript with C++ within the Godot game engine has resulted in a 50% reduction in input latency, ensuring precise and responsive controls for enhanced player mobility and strategy.

Weapon Variety: Engage in strategic battles with a selection of over 5 different weapons, including bombs, hammers, and blank guns, allowing players to customize their gameplay style and tactics.
